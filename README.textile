h1. ExpressionEngine Data API

This is a drop in channel and entry data API for ExpressionEngine. No installation is required, simply copy the required files and the data API will utilise your existing ExpressionEngine configuration.  

This module will create a REST server for accessing stored channel and entry data.  Requests can be appended with either  ".xml" or ".json" to denote the desired return format.


h2. Disclaimer

This module should be considered in "alpha" state and is not ready for production use.  There is no security sandbox implemented, so all channel and entry data stored in EE will be made public.

h2. Usage

Once installed (simply copy the files to the root of your EE installation you can make the following requests from your web service or browser:

<pre>
  //Request all entries
  http://example.com/api

  //Request all entries in the 'blog' channel
  http://example.com/api/blog

  //Request a single entry_id in the 'blog' channel
  http://example.com/api/blog/12

  //To change the return format, simply append 'json' or 'xml'
